/// transducer and a search, and the latency the user complains about belongs to exactly one of
/// them. <see cref="Source"/> is an ordinary <see cref="ActivitySource"/>, so a profiler,
/// <c>dotnet-trace</c>, or the app's own listener can sample it without this assembly knowing they
/// exist, and it costs nothing at all when nobody is listening.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="Reported"/> answers the other one: something went wrong that the caller will never
/// see. A microphone that fails to stop, a temp file that cannot be deleted, a provider rejected
/// during startup - none of these reach a <c>catch</c> anywhere up the stack, and a
/// <c>catch { }</c> with a comment is precisely how they stay invisible. Everything this library
/// swallows is announced here instead, and the app writes it to the same log as everything else.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// No transcript text, file contents, or audio is ever put on either face. Dictation is local by
/// construction and a log file that quotes what was said would undo that on disk; lengths and
/// durations answer the operational questions without recording what the user said.
